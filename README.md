This project is a volunteer manager for an organization named The Young Samaritans (a local high school group from Danville, PA). The idea is for volunteers to be able to sign in check the hours they have volunteered and sign up for events. There are also separate administrator accounts where supervisors can add/delete volunteers and add/delete events. 

This project was done with:
* Android App Studio
* Java
* xml
* Firebase database
